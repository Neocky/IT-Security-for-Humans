# IT Security Guidelines for Humans 💂‍

With the never ending uprise of ransomware attacks against every possible network environment, the need for new and 
improved network security solutions is on an all time high. To guard against the attacks a new security principle was
created: `Zero Trust`.

Sadly there were not good enough guides out there, which explained `Zero Trust` in an understandable manner with
examples. So i created this repository to help me and hopefully you, in understanding and implementing a `Zero Trust`
security solution in our network.

## Topics 📚
1. Government security principles
